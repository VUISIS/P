??? note "How to use this example"

    We assume that you have cloned the P repository locally.
    ```shell 
    git clone https://github.com/p-org/P.git
    ```

    The recommended way to work through this example is to open the [P\Tutorial](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial) folder in IntelliJ side-by-side a browser using which you can simulatenously read the description for each example and browser the P program in IntelliJ. 

We have reached the middle of our tutorials :yawning_face:, its time to take a break and have an espresso coffee! :coffee:

P has been used in the past to implement device drivers and robotics systems (see [case studies](../casestudies.md) and [publications](../publications.md#p-case-studies)). One of the many challenges in implementing such systems is that they are reactive systems and hence, must handle various sequence of events (inputs) appropriately depending on its current mode of operation.

**System:** We consider a fun example of modeling an espresso coffee machine and see how we can use P state machines to model a reactive system that must respond correctly to various user inputs.
The user interacts with the coffee machine through its control panel.

![Placeholder](espressomachine.png){ width=50% align=center }

The control panel presents an interface to the user to perform operations like `reset` machine, turn `steamer` on and off, request an `espresso`, and clear the `grounds` by opening the container. The control panel interprets these inputs from the user and sends appropriate commands to the coffee maker. We demonstrate how using P state machine, one can capture the required reactive behavior control panel and define how it must handle different user inputs.

**Correctness Specifications:**
P checker by default checks that every event that is received in any state has a handler defined for it, otherwise, it results in an unhandled event exception. If the P checker passes then it implies that the system model can handle any sequence of events generated by the given environment which in our example's context implies that the coffee machine control panel can correctly handle any sequence of inputs (or button presses) by the user. We would also like to check that the coffee machine moves through a desired sequence of states, i.e., `reset -> warm-up -> make_espresso -> grind coffee -> run_espresso -> *`.

### P Project

The [1_ClientServer](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer) folder contains the source code for the [ClientServer](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/ClientServer.pproj) project. Please feel free to read details about the recommended [P program structure](../advanced/structureOfPProgram.md) and [P project file](../advanced/PProject.md).

### Models

The P models ([PSrc](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc)) for the ClientServer example consist of four files: 

- [Client.p](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Client.p): Implements the Client state machine.
  
??? tip "[Expand]: Lets walk through Client.p"
    - ([L19 - L22](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Client.p#L19-L22))  &rarr; Events `eWithDrawReq` and `eWithDrawResp` are used to communicate between the `Client` and the `Server` machines (manual: [event declaration](../manual/events.md)).
    - ([L3 - L17](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Client.p#L3-L17)) &rarr; Declares the payload types for the `eWithDrawReq` and `eWithDrawResp` events (manual: [user defined type](../manual/datatypes.md#user-defined)).
    - ([L25 - L95](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Client.p#L25-L95))  &rarr; Declares the `Client` state machine (manual: [P state machine](../manual/statemachines.md)).
        - The `Client` machine has a set of local variables used to store the local-state of the state machine ([L27 - L31](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Client.p#L27-L31)). `Init` state is the start state of the machine where the machine starts executions on being created. The entry function of the `Init` state initializes the local variables based on the parameters received on creation and jumps to the `WithdrawMoney` state.
        - In the `WithdrawMoney` state, the state machine checks if there is enough money in the account. If the balance is greater than 10 then it issues a random withdraw request to the bank by sending the `eWithDrawReq` event ([L55](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Client.p#L55)) otherwise it jumps to the `NoMoneyToWithDraw` state. After sending a withdraw request, the machine waits for the `eWithDrawResp` event ([L59](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Client.p#L59)). On receiving the `eWithDrawResp` event, the machine executes the corresponding event handler that confirms if the bank response is as expected and also if there is still money in the account then jumps back to the WithdrawMoney state. Note that each time we (re-)enter a state (through a transition or goto statement), its entry function is executed.



- [Server.p](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Server.p): Implements the BankServer and the backend Database state machines.
  
??? tip "[Expand]: Lets walk through Server.p"
    - ([L1 - L7](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Server.p#L1-L7)) &rarr; Declares the events used to communicate between the bank server and the backend database.
    - ([L9 - L48](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Server.p#L9-L48)) &rarr; Declares the `BankServer` machine. The BankServer machine uses a database machine as a service to store the bank balance for all its clients.
    On receiving an eWithDrawReq (withdraw requests) from a client, it reads the current balance for the account,
    if there is enough money in the account then it updates the new balance in the database after withdrawal
    and sends a response back to the client.
    - ([L50 - L74](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Server.p#L50-L74)) &rarr; Declares the `Database` machine. The Database machine acts as a helper service for the Bank server and stores the bank balance for
    each account. There are two API's or functions to interact with the Database: ReadBankBalance and UpdateBankBalance. These functions are implemented as global functions in P ([L76 - L92](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/Server.p#L76-L92)).

- [AbstractBankServer.p](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/AbstractBankServer.p): Implements the AbstractBankServer state machine that provides a simplified abstraction that unifies the BankServer and Database machines. We will demonstrate how one can replace the complex bank service (consisting of two interacting components, the BankServer and the Database) by its abstraction when testing the client application.

??? tip "[Expand]: Lets walk through AbstractBankServer.p"
    - ([L12 - L37](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/AbstractBankServer.p#L12-L37)) &rarr; Declares an abstraction of the BankServer machine. The `AbstractBankServer` provides an implementation of the Bank where
    the interaction between the BankServer and Database is abstracted away. We use the `AbstractBankServer` machine to demonstrate how one can replace a complex component in P with an abstraction that hides a lot of its internal complexity. For the client, it still exposes the same interface or behavior. Hence, when checking the correctness of the client it does not matter whether we pair it with the BankServer or the AbstractBankServer.

!!! info "Key Takeaway"
    To mitigate the state space explosion problem, when modeling and checking complex systems consisting of several components, we would like to check the correctness of each component in isolation. When doing this kind of a compositional reasoning, we replace the environment of the component with its abstraction. The abstraction basically exposes the same interface as the environment but removes its internal complexity, simplifying the overall problem of checking the correctness of the component under test. There is a large body of literature on doing compositional reasoning of distributed systems. You can start with [the Modular P paper](https://ankushdesai.github.io/assets/papers/modp.pdf). How to automatically replace a machine with its abstraction is described below.

- [ClientServerModules.p](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/ClientServerModules.p): Declares the P modules corresponding to each component in the system.

??? tip "[Expand]: Lets walk through ClientServerModules.p"
    - ([L1 - L5](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/ClientServerModules.p#L1-L5)) &rarr; Declares the `Client` and `Bank` modules. A module in P is a collection of state machines that together implement that module or component. A system model in P is then a composition or union of modules. The `Client` module consists of a single machine `Client` and the `Bank` module is implemented by machines `BankServer` and `Database` together (manual: [P module system](../manual/modulesystem.md)).  
    - ([L7 - L8](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSrc/ClientServerModules.p#L7-L8)) &rarr; The `AbstractBank` module uses the `binding` feature in P modules to bind the `BankServer` machine to the `AbstractBankServer` machine. Basically, what this implies is that whenever `AbstractBank` module is used the creation of the `BankServer` machine will result in creation of `AbstractBankServer`, replacing the implementation with its abstraction (manual: [primitive modules](../manual/modulesystem.md#primitive-module)).

### Specifications

The P Specifications ([PSpec](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSpec)) for the ClientServer example are implemented in the [BankBalanceCorrect.p](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSpec/BankBalanceCorrect.p) file. We define two specifications:

- **BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect** (safety property): The BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect specification checks the global invariant that the account-balance communicated to the client by the bank is always correct and the bank never removes more money from the account than that withdrawn by the client! Also, if the bank denies a withdraw request then it is only because the withdrawal would reduce the account balance to below 10.
- **GuaranteedWithDrawProgress** (liveness property): The GuaranteedWithDrawProgress specification checks the liveness (or progress) property that all withdraw requests submitted by the client are eventually responded.

!!! info ""
    Stating that BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect checks that "if the bank denies a withdraw request then the request would reduce the balance to below 10 (< 10)" is equivalent to state that "if there is enough money in the account - at least 10 (>= 10), then the request must not error". Hence, the two properties BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect and GuaranteedWithDrawProgress together ensure that every withdraw request if allowed will eventually succeed and the bank cannot block correct withdrawal requests.

??? tip "[Expand]: Lets walk through BankBalanceCorrect.p"
    - ([L20](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSpec/BankBalanceCorrect.p#L20)) &rarr; Event `eSpec_BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect_Init` is used to inform the monitors about the initial state of the Bank. The event is announced by the TestDrivers when setting up the system ([here](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst/TestDriver.p#L51)).
    - ([L36 - L86](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSpec/BankBalanceCorrect.p#L36-L86)) &rarr; Declares the `BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect` safety spec machine that observes the events `eWithDrawReq`,  `eWithDrawResp`, and `eSpec_BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect_Init` to assert the required global invariant.
    - ([L92 - L115](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PSpec/BankBalanceCorrect.p#L92-L115)) &rarr; Declares the `GuaranteedWithDrawProgress` liveness spec machine that observes the events `eWithDrawReq` and `eWithDrawResp` to assert the required liveness property that every request is eventually responded by the Bank.
    - To understand the semantics of the P spec machines, please read manual: [p monitors](../manual/monitors.md).

### Test Scenarios

The test scenarios folder in P has two parts: TestDrivers and TestScripts. TestDrivers are collections of state machines that implement the test harnesses (or environment state machines) for different test scenarios. TestScripts are collections of test cases that are automatically run by the P checker.

The test scenarios folder for ClientServer ([PTst](https://github.com/p-org/P/tree/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst)) consists of two files [TestDriver.p](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst/TestDriver.p) and [TestScript.p](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst/Testscript.p).

??? tip "[Expand]: Lets walk through TestDriver.p"
    - ([L36 - L60](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst/TestDriver.p#L36-L60)) &rarr; Function `SetupClientServerSystem` takes as input the number of clients to be created and configures the ClientServer system by creating the `Client` and `BankServer` machines. The [`CreateRandomInitialAccounts`](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst/TestDriver.p#L25-L34) function uses the [`choose`](../manual/expressions.md#choose) primitive to randomly initialize the accounts map.
    - ([L3 - L22](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst/TestDriver.p#L3-L22)) &rarr; Machines `TestWithSingleClient` and `TestWithMultipleClients` are simple test driver machines that configure the system to be checked by the P checker for different scenarios. In this case, test the ClientServer system by first randomly initializing the accounts map and then testing it with either one `Client` or with multiple `Client`s (between 2 and 4)).

??? tip "[Expand]: Lets walk through TestScript.p"
    P allows programmers to write different test cases. Each test case is checked separately and can use a different test driver. Using different test drivers triggers different behaviors in the system under test, as it implies different system configurations and input generators. To better understand the P test cases, please look at manual: [P test cases](../manual/testcases.md).
    - ([L4 - L16](https://github.com/p-org/P/blob/master/Tutorial/1_ClientServer/PTst/Testscript.p#L4-L16)) &rarr; Declares three test cases each checking a different scenario and system. The system under test is the `union` of the modules representing each component in the system (manual: [P module system](../manual/modulesystem.md#union-module)).
    - In the `tcSingleClientAbstractServer` test case, instead of composing with the Bank module, we use the AbstractBank module. Hence, in the composed system, whenever the creation of a BankServer machine is invoked the binding will instead create an AbstractBankServer machine.

### Testing ClientServer

You can get the list of test cases defined in the ClientServer program by passing the generated `dll`
to the P Checker:

```shell
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll
```

??? note "Expected Output"

    ```shell hl_lines="5 6 7"
    pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll

    Provide /method or -m flag to qualify the test method name you wish to use. 
    Possible options are::
    PImplementation.tcSingleClient.Execute
    PImplementation.tcMultipleClients.Execute
    PImplementation.tcSingleClientAbstractServer.Execute
    ```

There are three test cases defined in the ClientServer project and you can specify which
test case to run by using the `-m` parameter along with the `-i` parameter for the number of schedules to explore.

Check the `tcSingleClient` test case for 1000 schedules:

```
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll \
    -m PImplementation.tcSingleClient.Execute \
    -i 1000
```

Check the `tcMultipleClients` test case for 1000 schedules:

```
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll \
    -m PImplementation.tcMultipleClients.Execute \
    -i 1000
```

Check the `tcSingleClientAbstractServer` test case for 1000 schedules:

```
pmc <Path>/ClientServer.dll \
    -m PImplementation.tcSingleClientAbstractServer.Execute \
    -i 1000
```

!!! danger "Error"
    `tcSingleClientAbstractServer` triggers an error in the AbstractBankServer state machine. Please use the [guide](../advanced/debuggingerror.md) to explore how to debug an error trace generated by P Checker.

### Exercise Problem

- [Problem 1] Fix the bug in AbstractBankServer state machine and run the P Checker again on the test case to ensure that there are no more bugs in the models.
- [Problem 2] Extend the ClientServer example with support for depositing money into the bank. This would require implementing events `eDepositReq` and `eDepositResp` which are used to interact between the client and server machine. The Client machine should be updated to deposit money into the account when the balance is low and the BankServer machine implementation would have to be updated to support depositing money into the bank account. After implementing the deposit feature, run the test-cases again to check if the system still satisfies the desired specifications.

!!! success "What did we learn through this example?"
    This was a fun example to demonstrate how to model a reactive system as a P state machine. We saw how using P monitors we can check that the system moves through the correct modes of operation.
